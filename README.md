Two remote-controlled dragsters controlled. Players use two controllers to drive the dragsters. The controllers have a throttle and a gear shifter, and the players must time their gear shifts for the optimal power output. The controller software simulates engine operation and the resulting power output. Players are penalized for red-lining, shifting too early or too late. The better driver wins!
